# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.

1. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: object destructuring is a technique that enables a shorthand for coding. In order to reference a state object the syntax would be {this.state.objectName} but when using object destructuring you can note the objectName to this.state in the following example,
  objectName = this.state
  so now you can reference {objectName} without having to write the full code {this.state.objectName}

  Researched answer: The object destructuring is a useful JavaScript feature to extract properties from objects and bind them to variables.
  What’s better, object destructuring can extract multiple properties in one statement, can access properties from nested objects, and can set a default value if the property doesn’t exist.

2. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer: changes to the DOM

  Researched answer: 
  - "A JavaScript can be executed when an event occurs, like when a user clicks on an HTML element."
  - "DOM (Document Object Model) events are actions that occurs as a result of the user action or as result of state change of the elements of a DOM tree." 

3. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: a class is the blueprint of an object--a reusable code. Whereas an object is a datatype.

  Researched answer: "A class is a template for objects. A class defines object properties including a valid range of values, and a default value. A class also describes object behavior. An object is a member or an "instance" of a class. An object has a state in which all of its properties have values that you either explicitly define or that are defined by default settings."

4. What is the difference between a HTML div and a span?

  Your answer: I know that a <div> is a container but I forget what a "span" is.

  Researched answer: "A div is a block-level element and a span is an inline element. The div should be used to wrap sections of a document, while use spans to wrap small portions of text, images, etc. The <div> element is used while creating CSS based layouts in html, whereas <span> element is used to stylize texts."

5. What is React.Fragment (or <>) and why would you want to use it?

  Your answer: I know that a react.fragment is necessary in the return of a class with outside components but I don't remember the purpose.

  Researched answer: "React fragments let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM because fragments are not rendered to the DOM. So basically we use React.Fragment where we would normally use a wrapper div."



6. What are three options for creating responsive design?

  Your answer: I'm not sure what "responsive design is" but if its refering to user input i would note <input />

  Researched answer: "Responsive web design (RWD) is a web development approach that creates dynamic changes to the appearance of a website, depending on the screen size and orientation of the device being used to view it"

Three Main Components of Responsive Design:
Responsive website design consists of the following three main components:

Flexible layouts - Using a flexible grid to create the website layout that will dynamically resize to any width.
Media queries - An extension to media types when targeting and including styles. Media queries allow designers to specify different styles for specific browser and device circumstances.
Flexible media - Makes media (images, video and other formats) scalable, by changing the size of the media as the size of the viewport changes.
